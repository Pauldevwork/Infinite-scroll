# Infinite-scroll

This project will be based on the infinite scroll designs like facebook, instagram, reddit and other sites with a lot of data and images that get displayed. 

I am using a demo API from Unsplashed so you might encounter a blank page, this is because the rate limit was exceeded and threw a 406 error.
The rate limit on Unsplashed is 50 requests per hour, once this is exceeded it denies access.

So if you are checking out my Github profile then plese remember this.

Thank you. 

p.s. This highlights the limitations of using API's on your website, API's are out of our control and this needs to be taken into consideration when building around them.
